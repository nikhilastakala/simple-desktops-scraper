## What...
Go visit http://simpledesktops.com ! They've - arguably - the best collection of minimal, beautiful, abstract art-esque wallpapers! I absolutely adore the official [Simple Desktops for Mac](http://simpledesktops.com/app/mac/) app; which cycles through a humongous collection of 1400+ such aforementioned wallpapers, at a set frequency.

When one of my friends was visibly quite bummed at the lack of something similar for Windows; we thought it best to scrape all the wallpapers and have the stock Windows wallpaper manager manage these!

Hence, this scraper!


## How to...
- Please ensure that NodeJS is installed on your computer.

- Run the following commands to start downloading the wallpapers.
```
npm install
npm run start
```

- You can run `npm run start` as many times as you wish (either in case of errors, or downloads that stop midway). Wallpapers which have already been downloaded, won't be downloaded again.


## 	Please...
Be a good netizen, and do use the scraped data for absolutely-personal purposes only! [Use of these desktop wallpapers is for personal use only, and shouldn't be sold or reposted without the expressed written consent of the desktop creator.](http://simpledesktops.com/about/)
